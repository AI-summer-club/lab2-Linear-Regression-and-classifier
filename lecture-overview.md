# AI Summer Camp: Linear Regression & Classification

## Lecture Overview

This lecture covers two fundamental concepts in machine learning: Linear Regression and Classification. The content is designed to provide both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.

### Main Topics:
1. Introduction to Linear Regression
2. Building a Linear Regression Model
3. Introduction to Classification
4. Building a Decision Tree Classifier

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the concept of linear regression and its applications
- Learn how to build and evaluate a linear regression model
- Grasp the basics of classification algorithms
- Gain hands-on experience with decision tree classifiers

### Structure:
- Each topic will include theoretical explanations followed by practical examples
- We'll use Python and popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib
- Datasets: We'll work with the House Prices dataset for regression and the Iris dataset for classification

### Note:
- Feel free to ask questions throughout the lecture
- We'll have hands-on coding sessions, so please have your Python environment ready
